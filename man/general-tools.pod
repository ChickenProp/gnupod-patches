=head1 COEXISTENCE

GNUpod can coexist with iTunes and other programs for the iPod.

If you want to use an iPod with GNUpod and used something other than
GNUpod (maybe iTunes) to perform the last update (adding songs,
editing playlists.. doing something..), you'll have to use
C<tunes2pod.pl> to update the (outdated) GNUtunesDB.

	tunes2pod.pl -m /mnt/ipod

The iPod is now ready again for GNUpod.

You have to do this because GNUpod stores its information in the
GNUtunesDB, but other programs access the iTunesDB directly. After you
did something with eg. iTunes, the GNUtunesDB would be 'outdated' and
you would lose any changes you made with iTunes. Running C<tunes2pod.pl>
will write a new GNUtunesDB which reflects the content of the current
iTunesDB.

=head1 DISASTER RECOVERY

It is recommended that before editing your
F<iPod_Control/.gnupod/GNUtunesDB.xml> file yourself, that you make a
back-up of it.  Most of the gnupod tools also make a backup of it before
making any changes and store that backup in
F<iPod_Control/.gnupod/GNUtunesDB.xml.old>.

=head2 Not running mktunes.pl

If you unmount your iPod without running C<mktunes.pl> then you'll find
that none of the changes you made (including adding songs) will appear to
have taken effect.  You should be able to remount your iPod, run
C<mktunes.pl> and unmount to recover from this.

=head2 mktunes.pl failed

If C<mktunes.pl> fails (perhaps you hit ctrl-c because it was taking too
long) then the iTunes database may be left corrupted.  If you unmount at
this point, your iPod may appear to have no files at all.

If you are using Ubuntu 9.04 or above, and you found C<mktunes.pl> was
taking too long, you can either tell GNUpod your iPod's ID directly:

	mktunes.pl -m /mnt/ipod --fwguid 0123456789abc...

or upgrade your version of the GNUpod tools in order for C<mktunes.pl> to work again.
You can do that with the following commands:

	sudo su -
	apt-get remove gnupod-tools
	apt-get -y install cvs
	apt-get -y install autoconf
	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/gnupod co gnupod
	cd gnupod
	autoconf
	./configure
	make install

In any case, remount your iPod, run C<mktunes.pl> again and unmount.  That
should fix the problem.

iPod models from late 2007 and onwards (3rd and later generation Nano,
Classic, Touch) refuse to work unless the iTunesDB has been signed with a
sha1 hash.  This hash helps to detect corrupted databases, prevents sharing
an iTunesDB between multiple iPods and locks out non-apple software. GNUpod
is able to create the required hash value if it knows the iPods serial
number, this is a 16 chars long hex value such as: `000ba3100310abcf' and
should be auto-detected on GNU/Linux (via `/sbin/udevadm info') and
Solaris (via `prtconf -v').  If GNUpod somehow fails to find the correct
serial number of your iPod (as it can with recent versions of Ubuntu)
you'll have to specify the correct value using the `--fwguid' switch of
`mktunes.pl'.

=head2 After a crash (or a failure to unmount)

If your computer crashed while uploading/deleting songs, you may have
some 'zombie' files.  This can also occur if you forget to unmount your
iPod before you unplug it from the computer.

In this case, you can use C<gnupod_check.pl> to search 'lost' files.
gnupod_check.pl will tell you what you could do to fix it.

If gnupod_check.pl found many errors (or you lost your
F<GNUtunesDB.xml>), you can 'rebuild' an GNUtunesDB using:

     gnupod_addsong.pl --restore -m /mnt/ipod

This won't delete any songs on the iPod but will attempt to recreate the
F<GNUtunesDB.xml> file including the Songs which are on the iPod and their
mp3 header information.  Playlists, and any additional information you've
added may be lost.

If you have a recent copy of your F<GNUtunesDB.xml>, you may find it useful
to back-up the new, restored F<GNUtunesDB.xml> file and overwrite it with
yours.  Then run C<mktunes.pl>.  This might be sufficient to return your
iPod to the previous state (although if you've added or removed songs etc;
then it might not work).

The full documentation for gnupod is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the info program and GNUpod are properly installed at your site, the command

    info gnupod

should give you access to the complete manual.
Individual programms have their own man page.
