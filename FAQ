1. What is GNUpod?
------------------
With GNUpod, you can use your iPod on GNU/Linux and
many other Operating Systems (with a useable Port
of Perl5 + FireWire / USB2 Support)

GNUpod is a collection of Perlscripts. They
handle the iPod internals for you ;)
[Apples Binary Filetypes..]


2. Wich iPods are supported?
----------------------------
GNUpod is known to work with

- Firmware 1.x (1&2nd gen. iPods)
- Firmware 2.x (3. gen iPod)

And it should work with the iPod-Mini
(I didn't test it, i 'only' own a 1 & 3 gen iPod...)


3. Quick howto
--------------
A quick Howto for a fresh (virgin) iPod

 0 Install gnupod:
   ./configure && make install
 
 1 Mount the iPod (eg. /mnt/ipod)
 2 run gnupod_INIT.pl -m /mnt/ipod
 3 add songs using 'gnupod_addsong.pl -m /mnt/ipod *blabla.mp3
 4 build the iTunesDB using mktunes: 'mktunes.pl -m /mnt/ipod'
 5 umount the iPod and enjoy!

 If you add more songs, repeat step 1-5 (without step 2!) :
 1 Mount the iPod
 2 use gnupod_addsong.pl
 3 build the database with mktunes.pl
 4 umount

Please read the README file and the info page
(info gnupod) or have a look at doc/gnupod.html


4. How about a GUI?
-------------------
I don't like GUIs, thats why GNUpod has only
a CLI interface.

I work much faster with CLI tools, but feel free to create
a GUI for GNUpod.

But there are some GNUpod 'forks'

- GTKpod     http://gtkpod.sf.net ('Inspired' by mktunes.pl / iTunesDB.pm)
- Rhythmbox  http://www.rhythmbox.org/ (Uses GTKpod code)

(<ironic>..and some companies created commercial iPod apps.. and i'm sure
 they didn't look at my source ;-) </ironic> .. sad)


5. Does GNUpod support feature $foobar?
---------------------------------------

Firmware 1.x
 - IMHO all features are supported
   (= Filebrowser + Playlists)
   ..GNUpod doesn't 'support' the
   Contacts feature, etc. (Normal .vcf files..)

Firmware 2.x
 - On-The-Go Playlists are supported
   -> GNUpod converts the On-The-Go Playlist
      into On-The-Go $NUMBER (Like iTunes does...)
 - Rating is supported
 - Basic Smart-Playlist support is implemented
   -> See README.smartplaylists
   

6. Can i add File-Format $foobar ?
----------------------------------

The iPod supports 3 Filetypes:

 - MP3
 - Apple AAC/ALAC files (.m4a)
 - PCM (.wav)

gnupod_addsong.pl can read this 3 formats.

GNUpod does (currently) *NOT* support:

 - Audible.com files (DRM)
 - Apple MusicStore files (.m4p - DRM AAC) but it does support .m4a

GnuPod >= 0.96 can convert FLAC and OGG files 'on the fly'.
You'll have to call gnupod_addsong.pl with the
--decode switch. see 'man gnupod_addsong.pl' for more details
(Or read the complete docs: 'info gnupod')

DRM-Support isn't planned.

But gnupod works pretty well with M4A files from allofmp3.com


7. How can i add files recursive?
---------------------------------

gnupod_addsong.pl can read from stdin :)

$ find blabla/ | gnupod_addsong.pl -

(note the '-')


8. How to get parseable output from gnupod_search.pl
----------------------------------------------------

gnupod_addsong.pl knows the '--view' switch.

Example: 
gnupod_search.pl --view=i -l "Cure" 2>/dev/null | tail +4

(Hmm.. output breaks if On-The-Go data get's synced..)
FIXME.. maybe we should have an --out option?


9. Why?
-------

I wanted an iPod and after buying one, i realized that
nobody else created an application to support it on GNU/Linux, so
i did it myself :)
(Ok, tex9 created a commercial tool, but for x86 only...
 Such things don't work on ppc-linux ;) GNUpod does)

..And i had enough free time to do it :)


10. Do you have any specs about the iTunesDB format?
----------------------------------------------------

I didn't create a 'whitepaper' or something like this.

The source is the documentation ;)
But the iTunesDB-format isn't so complicated if you know how to
write the specific parts and how you'll have to assemble
them.
Just have a look at iTunesDB.pm and tunes2pod.pl+mktunes.pl

..or feel free to ask me questions about it:
<pab at blinkenlights.ch>


11. How do i report bugs or feature-requests?
---------------------------------------------

Send a mail to <bug-gnupod at nongnu.org>
..or <pab at blinkenlights.ch>



12. How can i contribute?
-------------------------

Use gnupod and:
 * Report bugs
 * Report weird things
 * Send me patches (better ;) )
 * Write better documentation
 * Buy me an iPod-Mini ;)
 * Donate via Paypal to paypal@blinkenlights.ch ;)
