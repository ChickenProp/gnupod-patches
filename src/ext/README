These programs work with the XML tunes database created by
GnuPod (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnupod/)

list.pl
	List the tunes database by album, by artist, etc.

renumber.pl
	Renumber the IDs of the database entries.
	Useful if you want to move entries around with a text editor
	and have the new order reflected in the database.

search.pl
	Search the database for entries that match a particular
	artist, album, or title.

	With the "-n" option, just IDs are printed,
	suitable for use with the gnupod_delete command.
