* Fixing bugs ;)
* Move manpages into the sources (so when adding a new cli
  switch, you can easily update the man page, too.)
* Support for 2nd/3rd generation shuffle replay gain
* Add gapless playback information when found in the tags. It is
  added by encoders like lame to eliminate gaps due to encoding 
  artifacts and block size mismatch (CD 75/s, MP3 40/s)
  AFAIK gtkpod already does it, so a look at their code and 
  asking on their list might reduce the amount of work.
* Prop every file with "use warnings;"
* Unify coding style in regard to
** Indentation
** Whitespaces
** Passing of parameters to subs. All but the most basic sub calls
   should use named parameters (i.e. one hashref) instead of
   positional parameter guesswork)
** Using explicit { } blocks vs statement modifiers
   "if (condition) { statement; }" vs. "statement if condition;"
** Add missing (developer) documentation to the code
* Support for 4th generation (speaking) shuffle iTunesSD
* Parallel re-encoding with several child processes
  for faster re-encoding on multi-core systems.
* Add Audible.com support
* Add LiveUpdate support for old Firmware and Clock-Bug on iPod-Mini
