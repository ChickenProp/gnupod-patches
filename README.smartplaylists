About SmartPlaylist-Support
===========================

GNUpod can read and write SmartPlaylists.
Please note that this feature isn't supported
for iPods running Firmware 1.x
(Because GNUpod can only do 'liveupdates' at the moment..)

Use the <regex.. stuff if you own a 1.x iPod.

Smartplaylists are powerful but it's ugly to create them.

An example for a SmartPlaylist:

   <smartplaylist checkrule="both" limititem="song" limitsort="random" limitval="55" liveupdate="1" name="Example SPL1" >
     <spl action="gt" field="bitrate" string="189" />
   </smartplaylist>

This Playlist includes 55 songs (limitval/limititem) sort by random (limitsort)
with a Bitrate > 189 (<spl field)

Please note that you have to set liveupdate="1" or the Playlist will be empty :)
[Because GNUpod can only do liveupdates atm..]


It's a bit complicated, maybe you should have a look at
http://blinkenlights.ch/gnupod/mkspl.html
 [or doc/mkspl.html]
You can use Mozilla (needs JS & DOM) to create
SmartPlaylists via Klickibunti interface ;)



##### SMARTPLAYLIST
CHECKRULE:
 limit (Only match <smartplaylist ... stuff, don't watch <spl.. entries)
 spl   (Only match <spl entries, don't limit or sort)
 both  (Match both items)
 
LIMITITEM:
 minute
 megabyte
 song
 hour
 gigabyte
 
LIMITSORT:

 addtime_low
 playcount_high
 playcount_low
 lastplay_high
 lastplay_low
 rating_high

##### SPL
FIELD for use with action IS/CONTAINS/STARTWITH/ENDWITH (use NOT_ for 'not' -> 'NOT_IS'   [STRINGS]
 TITLE
 ALBUM
 ARTIST
 GENRE
 FDESC
 COMMENT
 COMPOSER
 GROUP

FIELD for use with action eq/gt/lt/range (Use ! for 'not' -> '!eq') [NUM]
 bitrate
 srate
 year
 changetime (MAC TIMESTAMP!)
 tracknum
 size
 time
 addtime (MAC TIMESTAMP!)
 playcount
 lastplay (MAC TIMESTAMP!)
 cdnum
 rating (20 = 1 star / 60 = 3 starts ...-> STARTS*20 = Value)
 compilation (0 or 1)
 bpm

There is also a 'within' field for use with
 changetime
 addtime
 lastplay
 
 The 'value' of a within field needs a suffix: _day / _week / _month
 So you could write 
   <spl action="within" field="lastplay" value="2_month"/> 
 to add all songs played within the last 2 months.
 You could also use a ! to invert the result: (=NOT within)
   <spl action="!within" field="lastplay" value="2_month"/>
