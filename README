#Blabla FIXME.. write a better README file..

What is GNUpod?
---------------
With GNUpod, you can use your iPod on GNU/Linux and
many other Operating Systems (with a useable Port
of Perl5 + FireWire / USB2 Support)


Installing GNUpod
-----------------
Running
 #./configure
 #make install
should be enough.

FIXME: gnuPod doku updaten und hierhin kopieren..


Using GNUpod
------------
After installing GNUpod, you can use
#info gnupod

to view GNUpod's info page.

An HTML Version of the info-page is also
included in this package (see doc/)


Why?
----
I wrote GNUpod, because i had to kill
my OSX Partition (small HardDisk ;) ) and
wanted to use the iPod without Dual-booting..
(..and iTunes sucks)


FAQ
---

Q: How about a GUI?
A: GNUpod will never (?) have a GUI,
   if you wan't one, use gtkpod
   (http://gtkpod.sf.net), it's a
   'rewrite' of the old GNUpod in C

   ..but GNUpod can easy be (ab-)used
   as a 'backend' for an GUI ;)


Q: What about 'SmartPlaylists' ?
A: I'm working on support for SPL's,
   but GNUpod has a much more powerful
   Feature: 'regex' and 'iregex' playlists.
   Read the docs :)

Q: How about HFS+ on GNU/Linux?
A: http://www.ardistech.com/hfsplus/ :)
   Still in beta-stage (like GNUpod ;) )
   but looks interesting..
