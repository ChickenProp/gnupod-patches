FAQ
---

Q: How about a GUI?
A: GNUpod will never (?) have a GUI,
   if you wan't one, use gtkpod
   (http://gtkpod.sf.net), it's a
   'rewrite' of the old GNUpod in C

   ..but GNUpod can easy be (ab-)used
   as a 'backend' for an GUI ;)


Q: What about 'SmartPlaylists' ?
A: I'm working on support for SPL's,
   but GNUpod has a much more powerful
   Feature: 'regex' and 'iregex' playlists.
   Read the docs :)

Q: How about HFS+ on GNU/Linux?
A: http://www.ardistech.com/hfsplus/ :)
   Still in beta-stage (like GNUpod ;) )
   but looks interesting..

Q: I found a bug (feature ;) )
A: Tell me more about it ;) mailto:pab@blinkenlights.ch
