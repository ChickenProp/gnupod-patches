* the iTunesDB format is not 'open' (no specification provided)
  We don't support all features (like SmartPlaylists)
* FileMagic (qt parser)  is just a dummy, but i got a 'working' parser..
  ..should be ready soon.. (0.93?)
* GNUpod doesn't like duplicate id's
* Smartplaylist support isn't tested very well
