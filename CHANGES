gnuPod 0.29-rc1
- Unicode Support!!
  Use an UNICODE Texteditor to edit the GNUtunesDB..
  (Like 'yudit' or the gnome2 texteditor)
  Your old latin1 GNUtunesDB will get converted to an
  UTF8 version after running tunes2pod.pl/gnupod_addsong.pl or
  gnupod_delete.pl

  UTF8 Support isn't testet very well, and gnuPod 0.28 maybe more
  Stable for you.. but as you can see: somebody is working on it ;)
- 'Rebuild' mode does now *never* check for duplicates
- gnupod_delete doesn't kill some playlists if you tried to
  kill ID 0

 > Documentation aviable as TexInfo
 > GNU-Style build system (configure/make)
- You can now create (mktunes) and convert (tunes2pod)
  empty playlists (0 songs)
  This isn't usefull, but iTunes can do it and we should
  also be able to do it.
- tunes2pod supports now buggy, ehr. funny playlists
  written by MusicMatch
- Playlists are now sorted on the iPod as they are found
  in the GNUtunesDB - file
- mktunes.pl no longer accepts <playlist..> when </file> was
  not found.

- Timestamp should now be set correct
  (utime(undef,undef.. didn't work on every OS..)
- new playist keywords. You can now use <regex ..
  to create a playlist using regular expressions.
  <regex is case sensitive, use <iregex if you want case INsensitive
  checking
