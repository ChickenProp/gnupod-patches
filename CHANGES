     *** OLD RELEASES ***

gnuPod 0.26
- We are going to be a GNU package:
 > Support for LongOpts
 > Documentation aviable as TexInfo
 > GNU-Style build system (configure/make)
- You can now create (mktunes) and convert (tunes2pod)
  empty playlists (0 songs)
  This isn't usefull, but iTunes can do it and we should
  also be able to do it.
- tunes2pod supports now buggy, ehr. funny playlists
  written by MusicMatch
- Playlists are now sorted on the iPod as they are found
  in the GNUtunesDB - file
- mktunes.pl no longer accepts <playlist..> when </file> was
  not found.
- gnupod_addsong.pl handles long filenames now better
- Timestamp should now be set correct
  (utime(undef,undef.. didn't work on every OS..)
- new playist keywords. You can now use <regex ..
  to create a playlist using regular expressions.
  <regex is case sensitive, use <iregex if you want case INsensitive
  checking
