GNUpod 0.94 - codename 'aspartam'


Summary (hmm.. it's a long summary..):
--------------------------------------
- Nobody did buy me a 40gb iPod with Firmware 2.x

- I bought one myself

- gnupod_addsong.pl understands .m4a files
  (= AAC Files written by iTunes)
  I don't know if it works with DRM files (.m4p?)
  I don't have any DRM files and i'm not interested
  in DRM files...
  If you like to see support for DRM files, send
  me a patch ;-)

- Added support for On-The-Go playlists!
  (2.x Firmware-only-feature)

- GNUpod can now handle the 'Rating' set
  on the iPod (2.x Firmware-only-feature)
  It does also update the Playcounts on v2
  iPods

- GNUpod checks if the iTunesDB did change and
  runs tunes2pod.pl if it has to run it

- Changed rating-schema to match SPL-Rating
  -> Rating 5 is now 100 (newrating=oldrating*20)
  mktunes.pl will drop old (= now invalid) ratings,
  no autoconvert... sorry.. but does anyone care?

- gnupod_addsong.pl understands ID3v2.2 tags

- You'll have to install Digest::MD5

- You can also call your GNUtunesDB
  GNUtunesDB.xml



Details:
--------

I removed the '-x' and '-i' switch, because
it wouldn't work well together with the
autosync

FooBar.pm:
 * connect() changed a lot

FileMagic.pm:
 * Stupid bug: We can now also read
   ID3v2.2 tags - Thanks to
   David Ranch for the Bugreport
 * Detect Arrays returned by MP3::Info
   (no ARRAY(XXX) on the iPod anymore :) )

iTunesDB.pm
 * Added 'Play Counts' parser (=Rating)
 * Changed rating Schema
 * _itop() checks for very big values and dies

QTfile.pm
 * A dirty QuickTime parser

gnupod_otgsync.pl
 * A new tool, don't use it yourself :)
   It's only used internal.



*** OLD STUFF ***

GNUpod 0.93 - codename 'Shorthorn'

Summary:
--------
- Reading MusicMatch files should work (again)
- gnupod_addsong.pl can add WAVE files
- Parsing large iTunesDB files should be faster
  (-> we skip the MainPlayList)


Details:
--------
iTunesDB.pm and co:
 * Can read and write Playlist-Elements without child
   tunes2pod.pl couldn't read files written by
   (newer) MusicMatch releases.. this should fix the issue :)
 * Don't parse MasterPlaylists, do a seek()
   -> Speeds up parsing
 * Read and Write SamplingRate (Helps audible.com files? ..no)

FileMagic.pm
 * Fixed (Again?) ID3 reading (Charset handling still broken?!)
 * Read SamplingRate for MP3 Files

XMLhelper.pm
 * Output is sorted




GNUpod 0.92 - codename 'frau beyersdorf'

-> This version supports SmartPlaylists (BETA!)

iTunesDB.pm:
  * Fixed the very old 'gnupod versus iTunes' bug
    -> iTunes shouldn't try to 'resort' playlist items anymore
       (Note: iTunes will ALWAYS re-sort the playlists.. that's
        a 'feature' of iTunes)
  * Added 'eq syntax check', you can use (since 0.90) 
    'eq="#!#NUMBER#!#' to specify the EQ-Setting per song.
    mktunes.pl will now check if this syntax is correct.
    (You'll see a warning if it failed)
  * Fixed get_string() to handle null-size strings correct
  * Changed some internal things (using hrefs.. etc)
  * Misc SPL-Related code

XMLhelper.pm:
  * Misc cleanups
  * Added SPL-Support
  * Added check for playlist duplicates
  * Fixed escape bug for <playlist name=..

FileMagic.pm
  * Fixed (?) ID3v2 reading

tunes2pod.pl:
  * Added paranoia checks (stricter parsing)
  * Added SPL-Read code (BETA!)

mktunes.pl
  * Added SPL-Write support
  * regex-matches are sorted by id

gnupod_addsong.pl:
  * duplicate-checker displayed the
    wrong number of the dup, works again





GNUpod 0.91 

Much changed from 0.90 to 0.91.
I removed XML::Simple and use (again)
XML::Parser (Event based GNUpod.. .. again)
0.91 needs much less memory...

I hope i didn't break anything.. but...


gnupod_search.pl:
  * -d doesn't delete all songs anymore.. hups..
  * Playlist-Cleanup works now.. (another stupid bug.. :-/) 
  * Added '--title' switch to usage

gnupod_addsong.pl:
  * Can read from STDIN again (use 'gnupod_addsong.pl -')
    (I forgot this feature ;) )

gnupod_INIT.pl
  * Added '--france' switch (Limit volume to 100 db for
    1.x Firmware)

mktunes.pl
  * New Playlist-Code.. MUCH faster now
    (Wow.. again? no.. the code of 0.90 was
     VERY slow with many files (~3000) and more
     than ~15 big playlists)
  * Added '--volume' switch: Adjust the volume on the iPod!
    Use something like 'mktunes.pl --volume 70' to boost
    the volume by 70% (same as volume="70" in the GNUtunesDB)

XMLhelper.pm
  * Fixed the cleandoc() bug
  * Dropped XML::Simple.. it's stupid :-/

..and..
  Changed 'Win' to 'Windows/W32/etc'





GNUpod 0.90

- This is a *COMPLETE* rewrite of GNUpod, expect new bugs
  and some new features ;)

Highlights:

- Faster (?)
- REAL Unicode Support (Perl 5.8 and 5.6, .. i hope!)
- Cleaner Code (?)
- Support for elements like 'playcount / volume .. etc' (Read the docs)


This release isn't perfect but it works nice and i think its good
enough to be released :)

No Support for AAC (mp4) and SPL (SmartPlayLists) in this release, 
but AAC Support will be added soon (GNUpod 0.91?) and adding
SPL Support is possible ;)


gnuPod 0.29-rc1
- Unicode Support!!
  Use an UNICODE Texteditor to edit the GNUtunesDB..
  (Like 'yudit' or the gnome2 texteditor)
  Your old latin1 GNUtunesDB will get converted to an
  UTF8 version after running tunes2pod.pl/gnupod_addsong.pl or
  gnupod_delete.pl

  UTF8 Support isn't testet very well, and gnuPod 0.28 maybe more
  Stable for you.. but as you can see: somebody is working on it ;)
- 'Rebuild' mode does now *never* check for duplicates
- gnupod_delete doesn't kill some playlists if you tried to
  kill ID 0


gnuPod 0.28
- Rewritten Playlistcode for tunes2pod.pl
- tunes2pod.pl doesn't kill your empty GNUtunesDB anymore
  if it can't find the iTunesDB
- mktunes.pl uses now binmode(), maybe this helps
  RedHat 8 ? .. (and win32 ;) )
- mktunes.pl is now *much* faster!!
- the GNUtunesDB written by gnupod_delete.pl looks
  nicer now :) (id= is now always the first element..)

gnuPod 0.27 codename 'codename'
- We are now on gnu.org
- Fixed 'creating playlists' sample in documentation.
- Firmware 1.1.0 can read FAT32, updatet documentation.
- gnupod_delete.pl doesn't kill regex playlists anymore (ouch)
- gnupod_search.pl supports -g(enre)
 (Thanks to Johan Ruttenberg)

gnuPod 0.26
- We are going to be a GNU package:
 > Support for LongOpts
 > Documentation aviable as TexInfo
 > GNU-Style build system (configure/make)
- You can now create (mktunes) and convert (tunes2pod)
  empty playlists (0 songs)
  This isn't usefull, but iTunes can do it and we should
  also be able to do it.
- tunes2pod supports now buggy, ehr. funny playlists
  written by MusicMatch
- Playlists are now sorted on the iPod as they are found
  in the GNUtunesDB - file
- mktunes.pl no longer accepts <playlist..> when </file> was
  not found.
- gnupod_addsong.pl handles long filenames now better
- Timestamp should now be set correct
  (utime(undef,undef.. didn't work on every OS..)
- new playist keywords. You can now use <regex ..
  to create a playlist using regular expressions.
  <regex is case sensitive, use <iregex if you want case INsensitive
  checking


gnuPod 0.25 (API-Freeze i think ;) )
- New Syntax (We use getopt)
- Many small bugfixes
- Fixed mktunes and tunes2pod 'touch' bug
- tunes2pod creates now a nicer XML file
- 'composer' added to gnupod_addsong.pl
- Fixed 'Genere' - 'genre' typo.. args!
 (Thanks to Guillaume Leclanche)
- gnupod_addsong.pl knows now winamp genres (NOT generes!! *doh!*)
- gnupod_addsong.pl can now read from stdin, for example:
  find /blabla/foo | gnupod_addsong.pl -gm /mnt/ipod -
 (note the -g switch (no need to press ENTER) and '-')
 (Many thanks to Scott Savarese)

gnuPod 0.22 
- Bugfix in tunes2pod for Perl 5.8
 (Many thanks to Orion Buckminster Montoya)
- tunes2pod typo corrected *doh!*
 (Orion Buckminster Montoya again :) )
- Support for tracknumbers like "01/18"
 (Many thanks to Darrell Golliher)
- Support for 'composer' tag (just in XML/iTunesDB, not ID3)
 (Thanks to Alexey Marinichev for providing the ID :) )
 
 
gnuPod 0.21
- Fixed stupid tunes2pod.pl bug with big iTunesDBs
 (Thanks to Ciamac Moallemi for reporting and providing a patch)
- Support for songnum, songs, cdnum, cds and year


gnuPod 0.2
