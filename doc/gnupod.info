File: gnupod.info,  Node: Installation of GNUpod,  Next: Using FireWire with GNU/Linux,  Up: Installing GNUpod

3.1 Installation of GNUpod
==========================

The installation of GNUpod is very simple:

     tar -xzvf gnupod-tools-VERSION.tar.gz
     cd gnupod-tools/
     ./configure
     make install

   The `configure' script checks if the desired Perl modules are
installed.

   On Debian GNU/Linux you'll simply have to run these commands to
install the required Perl modules:
     apt-get install libfile-ncopy-perl
     apt-get install libmp3-info-perl
     apt-get install libunicode-string-perl
     apt-get install libxml-parser-perl
     apt-get install libxml-simple-perl

   If you are using a RPM-based Distribution (Mandrake, RedHat, SuSE..)
try http://www.rpmfind.net.

   Another way is to install the modules 'by hand'.

   http://search.cpan.org

   will help you to find the needed tarballs.  If you don't know how to
install them, please read

   http://cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_install_Perl_modules

   (Maybe you'd like to use the CPAN-Shell.. Google knows how to use it
;-) )

3.2 Using FireWire with GNU/Linux
=================================

Of course the Linux kernel must support FireWire. If the one you are
using doesn't have FireWire support you'll have to recompile your
Kernel. (It's also a good idea to update the Kernel when you are doing
this...)

   If you don't know how to compile the Linux kernel, please read
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/faq/index.php3#compile

   To get FireWire working, you should configure the Kernel like this:

   * Code maturity level options - y

   * IEEE1394 (FireWire)/IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support (Experimental) - y

   * OHCI-1394 support - m

   * SBP-2 support - m

   Feel free to build OHCI-1394 into the kernel ('y'), but make sure to
compile SBP-2 support as module. It won't work well if you say 'y'
there!  If you don't own an OHCI-1394 FireWire card you may need to use
the LYNX driver instead.  But OHCI-1394 is the most common, please also
have a look at http://www.linux1394.org

   After you reboot with the new Kernel, you should now be able to
mount the iPod.  First load the OHCI-1394 module if you said 'm' to
OHCI-1394 support.
     modprobe ohci1394

   Now plug in the iPod and wait until you can see the 'hook-symbol'
and load the sbp2 module using
     modprobe sbp2

   Please keep in mind that FireWire support is still experimental and
you may see Kernel "oopses" and other nasty things.  If your system
hangs after loading sbp2 or mounting the iPod you may try to load sbp2
like this:
     modprobe sbp2 sbp2_max_speed=0 sbp2_serialize_io=1 sbp2_force_inquiry_hack=1

   This will slow down the transfer rate but should be much more stable.
Note: Firewire works very well with Linux 2.6. If you have problems
with Linux 2.4, you may want to upgrade to 2.6!

   After loading sbp2, use `dmesg' to get some information.  The output
should look like this (if you are running linux 2.4.20 or older):

     SBP-2 module load options:
     - Max speed supported: S400
     - Max sectors per I/O supported: 255
     - Max outstanding commands supported: 8
     - Max outstanding commands per lun supported: 1
     - Serialized I/O (debug): no
     - Exclusive login: yes
       Vendor: Apple     Model: iPod              Rev: 1.21
       Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
     Attached scsi removable disk sdb at scsi1, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
     SCSI device sdb: 9780750 512-byte hdwr sectors (5008 MB)
     sda: test WP failed, assume Write Enabled
      sda: sda1 sda2

   In this case, `/dev/sda' would be your iPod.

   Linux 2.4.21 (and newer) doesn't show such verbose output and your
iPod will not be detected while loading sbp2. Simply run
`rescan-scsi-bus.sh' which should find your iPod (See /proc/scsi/scsi).
(You can download 'rescan-scsi-bus.sh' at
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/rescan-scsi-bus.sh)

   You can now mount the iPod:
     mount -t vfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/ipod

   It's a good idea to add a line like this to the fstab
     /dev/sda2   /mnt/ipod   vfat   defaults,user,noauto,umask=000

   Note: avoid adding the 'sync' mount-option for flash based iPods
(Shuffle, Nano) because flash drives have a limited number of write
cycles.

   Note2: as you can see, we assume an FAT32/VFAT formatted iPod
(`-t vfat'); if you own an HFS+ formatted iPod (aka. Mac-iPod) please
have a look at the next section 'Convert your Mac iPod' before using
`mount'.


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Convert your Mac iPod,  Next: Firmware update,  Prev: Using FireWire with GNU/Linux,  Up: Installing GNUpod

3.3 Convert your Mac iPod
=========================

If the Operating System you are running doesn't have write support for
HFS+ and your iPod is HFS+ Formatted (aka 'Mac-iPod') you will have to
reformat the iPod.

   Note: Linux 2.6.4 includes HFS+ Read/WRITE Support(!)  It's still
experimental and may do nasty things. (But it works well for me...)  If
you build your kernel with HFS+ support, you don't have to convert your
iPod :)

   Please note that you will need an fdisk for DOS-Style partitions,
you will also need a kernel that supports Mac- (to read the firmware)
and Dos-style (to access the device after converting it) partitions.
If you are using GNU/Linux on x86, your fdisk should be fine, but if
you are running GNU/Linux on (for example) PowerPC you may have to get
a suitable fdisk from the util-linux package which can be retrieved
from: ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/

   Compile and install the pc-fdisk (and only the pc-fdisk!)
     tar -xjvf util-linux-X.XXx.tar.bz2
     cd util-linux-X.XXx
     ./configure
     cd fdisk
     make
     cp fdisk /usr/sbin/pc-fdisk

   We assume that your iPod is at `/dev/sda'. (No, don't mount the
iPod, simply plugin the iPod and make sure it got detected with `dmesg'.

   Here we go:

   First, we 'backup' the current Firmware
     dd if=/dev/sda2 of=backup_firmware

   This should result in a ~32MB file, now we have to kill the old
partition map and force the kernel to re-read the new (empty) map
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=10
     rmmod sbp2 && insmod sbp2

   Now we can use 'pc-fdisk' to create a new partition layout:
     pc-fdisk /dev/sda [start fdisk]


     Command (m for help): n [make new partition]
     Command action
        e extended
        p primary partition (1-4)
     p we want primary
     Partition number (1-4): 1
     First cylinder (1-608, default 1): [just press enter]
     Using default value 1
     Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-608, default 608): +32M [32M is the default for 1.x iPods]

     Command (m for help): n
     Command action
        e extended
        p primary partition (1-4)
     p
     Partition number (1-4): 2
     First cylinder (6-608, default 6): 6 [Just use the default value, press ENTER (don't worry if it isn't 6)]
     Using default value 6
     Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (6-608, default 608): [press ENTER]
     Using default value 608 [If you don't own a 5gb iPod, this value will be different, don't care about it]

     Command (m for help): t [Modify type]
     Partition number (1-4): 1
     Hex code (type L to list codes): 0 [we don't care about the warning below]
     Type 0 means free space to many systems
     (but not to Linux). Having partitions of
     type 0 is probably unwise. You can delete
     a partition using the `d' command.
     Changed system type of partition 1 to 0 (Empty)

     Command (m for help): t
     Partition number (1-4): 2 [this is where data will go]
     Hex code (type L to list codes): b [b=FAT32]
     Changed system type of partition 2 to b (Win95 FAT32)


     Command (m for help): w [Writing new partition. Can take a while.]
     The partition table has been altered!

     Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
     Syncing disks.

   Note: The first partition doesn't have to be 32M, it just needs
enough space to hold the firmware image (6M would be okay for firmware
130.bin).  Now we can rewrite the Firmwarebackup we created above.
     dd if=backup_firmware of=/dev/sda1

   You may ask why we now write the Firmware to sda1 while we read it
from sda2, the answer is simple: Before running fdisk, the iPod was a
Mac-iPod with a different Partition layout, but now the iPod is a
Windows-iPod, belive me: sda1 is correct.

   After writing back the Firmware we can format the iPod:
     mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n "LUNIX" /dev/sda2

   "LUNIX" is the name of the iPod, you can use another name if you
like. After mkfs.vfat is done, we remove sbp2:
     rmmod sbp2

   Unplug the iPod and pray. If everything went well, the iPod boots up
:).  If not, reread this section, if you are lost, feel free to drop me
a mail: bug-gnupod@nongnu.org (Btw: If you can't get the iPod into
diskmode again, try this: Reboot the iPod by pressing  'MENU+PLAY' ~ 5
seconds. While the iPod is booting, press (and hold) |<<+>>| (=Forced
Diskmode))

   It's a good idea to edit `/etc/fstab' and add a line for the iPod:
     /dev/sda2   /mnt/ipod   vfat   defaults,user,noauto,umask=000

3.4 Firmware update
===================

** Don't update the Firmware just for fun, only do it if you need a new
Firmware and/or the documentation told you to do this **

   Note: These steps do not work on late 2007 iPods (such as Classic,
Touch and 3th gen. Nano).

   Setup Firewire (or USB) as described in 'Using FireWire with
GNU/Linux', load the modules and make sure that sbp2 detected your iPod.
Mount the iPod and run `mktunes.pl' to bring the device into a 'clean'
state. Unmount the iPod after mktunes.pl finishes but do *not* unplug
the iPod. Ready? Ok, we assume your iPod is `/dev/sda':

   First you need to get a new Firmware image.  Checkout the latest
firmware list:
     wget -O list.gz http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net//WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/com.apple.jingle.appserver.client.MZITunesClientCheck/version
     gunzip list.gz

   Open the list in a text editor and find the correct Fimrware-URL for
your iPod model:

   Download the correct firmware image for your iPod
(http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61688 should help you
identify our iPod model) and extract it:
     # Example for ipod photo: iPod_11.1.2.1.ipsw : 11 = Model (Photo) 1.2.1 = Firmware version
     wget http://appldnld.apple.com.edgesuite.net/content.info.apple.com/iPod/SBML/osx/bundles/061-2694.20060912.ipDcD/iPod_11.1.2.1.ipsw
     unzip iPod_11.1.2.1.ipsw
       Archive:  iPod_11.1.2.1.ipsw
         inflating: Firmware-11.4.2.1
         inflating: manifest.plist

   Ok, we are now ready to write the new firmware to the iPod.

   If your iPod is HFS+ Formatted (your kernel supports 'mac-style'
partitions??), use
     dd if=Firmware-11.4.2.1 of=/dev/sda2  # <-- this is the extracted image, do NOT write the .ipsw file!
     sync

   to upgrade the Firmware. If you own a FAT32 Formatted iPod (most
common), use
     dd if=Firmware-11.4.2.1 of=/dev/sda1 # <-- this is the extracted image, do NOT write the .ipsw file!
     sync

   After `dd' finished (it can take some time), run a `sync' and unplug
the iPod.

   Please note: Your Warranty Is Now Void ;-)

   And please don't blame me if your iPod dies...

File: gnupod.info,  Node: Preparation,  Next: Configuration,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.1 Preparation
===============

Mount the iPod (I assume you mount it at /mnt/ipod) as described in
'Using FireWire with GNUpod'

   If the iPod is freshly formatted or you never used GNUpod before
with this iPod, run
     gnupod_INIT.pl -m /mnt/ipod

   gnupod_INIT.pl will create the default directory tree and creates an
empty GNUtunesDB (or if it finds an iTunesDB, it runs tunes2pod.pl to
convert the iTunesDB to an GNUtunesDB)

   Use
     gnupod_INIT.pl -m /mnt/ipod --france

   if you would like to enable the 'EU-Volume-Limit' (=decrease max.
volume).  This only works for iPods running Firmware 1.x

   Your iPod is now ready for GNUpod!


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Add files,  Prev: Preparation,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.2 Configuration
=================

(Note: You don't need to bother with the Configfile. GNUpod works fine
without it, but it could make your life easier)

   GNUpod >= 0.95 can read a simple Configfile.  An example comes with
GNUpod, see doc/gnupodrc.example

   Edit this file and save it as ~/.gnupodrc or on your iPod
(iPod_Control/.gnupod/gnupodrc)


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Add files,  Next: Search files,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.3 Add files
=============

To add files, we use the script called `gnupod_addsong.pl'.

   First, mount the iPod (eg. at /mnt/ipod) if it isn't mounted.

   If you would like to add the file /tmp/foo.mp3, run
gnupod_addsong.pl like this:
     gnupod_addsong.pl -m /mnt/ipod /tmp/foo.mp3

   You can also use wildcards:
     gnupod_addsong.pl -m /mnt/ipod /mnt/mp3/seiken_densetsu2_ost/* /mnt/mp3/xenogears/ost?/*

   It isn't possible to add the same MP3 multiple times,
gnupod_addsong.pl detects duplicates (Duplicate = same filesize/time
and ID3Tag name). You can disable the duplicate-detection with the
'-duplicate' switch.

   gnupod_addsong.pl understands MP3/WAV (RIFF) and M4A (Apple AAC - NO
DRM!) files.

   It can also convert FLAC and OGG files on-the-fly:

   Using this example, it would convert the two files into MP3 and add
them to the iPod.

     gnupod_addsong.pl -m /mnt/ipod myfile.flac myfile.ogg --decode=mp3

   (Note: To use all features of -decode, you will have to install
Audio::FLAC::Header, Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl, lame, flac, oggenc
and faac)

   gnupod_addsong.pl tries to 'auto-detect' the encoding of the ID3 Tag.
Sometimes this works (in most cases ;) ) sometimes it doesn't. If it
doesn't work for you, feel free to send me an example-file:

   DO NOT umount the iPod yet! First read the section 'Unplug the iPod'!


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Search files,  Next: Remove files,  Prev: Add files,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.4 Search files
================

GNUpod includes a tool called `gnupod_search.pl' that helps you search
for files.

   Maybe you would like to search for the artist called 'Schlummiguch'.
In this case, run
     gnupod_search.pl -m /mnt/ipod -a "Schlummiguch"

   Note: gnupod_search.pl assumes RegExp input.  Please have a look at
`gnupod_search.pl --help' for more information.


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Remove files,  Next: Edit tags,  Prev: Search files,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.5 Remove files
================

Removing files is done using `gnupod_search.pl -d'.  To Remove all
files from the artist 'Schlummiguch', run
     gnupod_search.pl -m /mnt/ipod -a "Schlummiguch" -d


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Edit tags,  Next: Creating playlists,  Prev: Remove files,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.6 Edit tags
=============

You can use `gnupod_search.pl' to edit tags (like artist, album, etc..)

     gnupod_search.pl --artist="Alfred Neumann" --rename="artist=John Doe" --rename="rating=100"

   This example searches all files from 'Alfred Neumann', changes the
artist into 'John Doe' and sets the rating to 5 Stars (5*20=100)

   Don't forget to run mktunes.pl!

   You could also edit the GNUtunesDB.xml with a text editor :-)


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Creating playlists,  Next: Dealing with podcasts,  Prev: Edit tags,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.7 Creating playlists
======================

Open the file `iPod_Control/.gnupod/GNUtunesDB' in a editor (It's an
XML File).

   To create a playlist named 'sweet' which holds the songs with the ID
1 and 2, create something like this:
     <playlist name="sweet">
      <add id="1" />
      <add id="2" />
     </playlist>

   You are not limited to use 'id', you can also use other attributes:
     <playlist name="bogus">
      <add album="seiken densetsu" bitrate="256" />
     </playlist>
   This would add every song from the album 'Seiken Densetsu' (<add..
is case INsensitive) with a bitrate of 256kbit/s.

   Since GNUpod 0.26 it's also possible to use Regular Expressions
(Regex).  See `perldoc perlre' to learn more about this

     <playlist name="Regex Demo">
      <regex album="^A" />
      <iregex album="^b" />
     </playlist>

   <regex is case sensitive, use <iregex to do case insensitive
matching.

   It's also possible to sort a playlist:

     <playlist name="By Album" sort="album">
      <regex artist="bach" />
     </playlist>

   This adds all songs from Bach, sorted by album (a..z). You can use
every `<file ..>' item (id, bitrate, title..) for `sort'.  Add 'reverse
' at the beginning, to reverse the sorting:

     <playlist name="By Title" sort="reverse title">
      <regex artist="U2" />
     </playlist>

   You can also use Smart-Playlists with Firmware >= 2.x

      <smartplaylist checkrule="spl" liveupdate="1" name="Example SPL1" >
        <spl action="eq" field="playcount" string="0" />
        <spl action="IS" field="artist" string="Jon Doe" />
      </smartplaylist>

       <smartplaylist checkrule="spl" liveupdate="1" name="Example SPL2" >
        <spl action="gt" field="bitrate" string="311" />
      </smartplaylist>

   'Example SPL1' matches all songs from 'Jon Doe' with playcount==0 (=
All songs from Jon Doe that heven't been played yet) 'Example SPL2'
matches all songs with a Bitrate > 331.  (See also
README.smartplaylists)

   For more examples have a look at `doc/gnutunesdb.example' included
in the GNUpod tarball.  Also check out
http://blinkenlights.ch/gnupod/mkspl.html for a 'JavaScript SPL-Creator'

   You can also use the -playlist option of gnupod_addsong.pl. This
will create and add the listed songs to the named playlist.

   Don't forget to run mktunes before umounting! (See 'Unplug the iPod')


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Dealing with podcasts,  Next: Adding cover artwork,  Prev: Creating playlists,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.8 Dealing with podcasts
=========================

To create a podcast playlist you just need to set the podcast flag to
'1':

      <playlist name="Test Podcast" podcast="1">
        <iregex artist="John Doe" />
      </playlist>

   Such a playlist will show up as a Podcast after running mktunes.pl

   gnupod_addsong.pl can also download podcasts and create such
playlists itself:

     gnupod_addsong.pl -p "Heute Morgen" --playlist-is-podcast http://pod.drs.ch/heutemorgen_mpx.xml

   Running this command will create a Playlist called 'Heute Morgen'
(`-p') and set `podcast="1"' (`--playlist-is-podcast').
`gnupod_addsong.pl' will then fetch the podcast from
`http://pod.drs.ch/heutemorgen_mpx.xml', download all (new) files and
add them to the 'Heute Morgen' playlist!


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Adding cover artwork,  Next: Unplug the iPod,  Prev: Dealing with podcasts,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.9 Adding cover artwork
========================

GNUpod can write cover artwork for video, nano and late 2007-nano
iPods. The internal image format is model specific, so you should give
GNUpod a hint about the image format it should use.

   If you own a video (compatible) iPod, set:
     model = video
   in your gnupod configuration file (found at ~/.gnupodrc or
$IPOD_MOUNTPOINT/iPod_Control/.gnupod/gnupodrc , see
doc/gnupodrc.exmaple for more details).  For the iPod nano you should
use:
     model = nano
   Late 2007-nanos need this setting:
     model = nano_3g
   Late 2008-nanos need this setting:
     model = nano_4g

   To specify a cover while adding files you'd use the `--artwork'
switch of `gnupod_addsong.pl'. Example:
     gnupod_addsong.pl --artwork cover.jpg *.mp3

   Use `gnupod_search.pl' to change/add artwork for existing files.
Example:
     # Set cover.jpg as artwork for all songs that match album =~ /Katamari/i
     gnupod_search.pl --artwork cover.jpg --album Katamari

   don't forget to run `mktunes.pl' afterwards.

   Note: Artwork added by GNUpod may vanish after using iTunes: GNUpod
does not inject the artwork into the id3-header of the file.  If iTunes
finds such a file (while scanning / changing tags) the artwork may get
dropped.


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Unplug the iPod,  Next: Recovering files,  Prev: Adding cover artwork,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.10 Unplug the iPod
====================

Before umounting the iPod, you have to call `mktunes.pl' which will
parse the GNUtunesDB XML file and convert it into the iTunesDB format.

   Simply run
     mktunes.pl -m /mnt/ipod

   Note: Since GNUpod 0.91, mktunes.pl has a '-volume' option which you
can use to boost the Volume.

     mktunes.pl -m /mnt/ipod --volume 40

   This would adjust the volume +40 percent. (You can also use '-100'
to get a silent iPod ;) )

   After `mktunes.pl' is done, you can umount the iPod and remove the
sbp2 module
     umount /mnt/ipod
     rmmod sbp2

   Added songs won't be visible on the iPod if you did not run
mktunes.pl before umounting the iPod.  (If you forgot to run
`mktunes.pl' before unpluging/umounting, simply mount the iPod again
and run it)


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Recovering files,  Next: Coexistence,  Prev: Unplug the iPod,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.11 Recovering files
=====================

If your computer crashed while uploading/deleting songs, you may have
some 'zombie' files.

   In this case, you can use 'gnupod_check.pl' to search 'lost' files.
gnupod_check.pl will tell you what you could do to fix it.

   If gnupod_check.pl found many errors (or you lost your
GNUtunesDB.xml), you can 'rebuild' an GNUtunesDB using
`gnupod_addsong.pl'

     gnupod_addsong.pl --restore -m /mnt/ipod

   First, it will create a clean, empty GNUtunesDB, it won't delete any
songs on the iPod.  Then, `gnupod_addsong.pl --restore' will re-create
a GNUtunesDB including the Songs which are on the iPod

   I think nobody will ever have to do this.. but it maybe usefull to
know that it's possible (Note: Of course you'll lose your Playlists)


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Coexistence,  Next: Late 2007 iPods,  Prev: Recovering files,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.12 Coexistence
================

GNUpod can coexist with iTunes and other programs for the iPod.

   If you want to use an iPod with GNUpod and used something other than
GNUpod (maybe iTunes)  to perform the last update (adding songs,
editing playists.. doing something..), you'll have to  use
`tunes2pod.pl' to update the (outdated) GNUtunesDB.

   Mount the iPod and run
     tunes2pod.pl -m /mnt/ipod

   The iPod is now ready again for GNUpod.

   You have to do this because GNUpod stores its information in the
GNUtunesDB, but other programs access the iTunesDB directly. After you
did something with eg. iTunes, the GNUtunesDB would be 'outdated' and
you would lose any changes you made with iTunes. Running `tunes2pod.pl'
will write a new GNUtunesDB which reflects the content of the current
iTunesDB.

   You sould avoid the use of 'extended playlist support' if you use
your iPod with other programs.

   The Playlist part of this file...
     <files>
     <file id="1" title="hello" album="foo"..
     <file id="2" title="boing" album="foo"..
     </files>
     <playlist name="extended">
      <add album="foo" />
     </playlist>

   ..would look like this after using tunes2pod.pl
     ...
     <playist name="extended">
      <add id="1" />
      <add id="2" />
     </playlist>

   The songs are still in the playlists, but the expressions you wrote
are 'lost'.


File: gnupod.info,  Node: Late 2007 iPods,  Prev: Coexistence,  Up: Using GNUpod

4.13 Late 2007 iPods
====================

Late 2007 iPod models (3gen Nano, Classic, Touch) refuse to work unless
the iTunesDB has been signed with a sha1 hash.  This hash helps to
detect corrupted databases, prevents sharing an iTunesDB between
multiple iPods and locks out non-apple software. GNUpod is able to
create the required hash value if it knows the iPods serial number,
this is a 16 chars long hex value such as: `000ba3100310abcf' and
should be autodetected on GNU/Linux (via `/proc/bus/usb/devices') and
Solaris (via `prtconf -v').  If GNUpod somehow fails to find the
correct serial number of your iPod you'll have to specify the correct
value using the `--fwguid' switch of `mktunes.pl'.

5.1 GNUtunesDB
==============

We talked a lot about the 'GNUtunesDB' and the 'iTunesDB' files, but
why do we need these two files and what's the difference ?

   Well, you can find the iTunesDB on your iPod at
`iPod_Control/iTunes/iTunesDB' .  This file is read by the iPod when
you 'boot' the device.  The iTunesDB is a small Database and stores
information about all MP3s on the iPod (Title, Artist, Path,
Bitrate...) and all Playlists: everything the iPod needs to know.

   The iTunesDB is a proprietary file format created by Apple.

   The GNUtunesDB (`iPod_Control/.gnupod/GNUtunesDB') holds the same
information like the iTunesDB, but it's a simple XML file: easy to
understand by humans and easy to edit by hand.

   Everytime you run `tunes2pod.pl', the iTunesDB will get parsed and
converted into an XML File (the GNUtunesDB).  `mktunes.pl' does the
opposite: it parses the XML file and creates an iTunesDB (for the iPod
and iTunes)

   Only mktunes.pl and tunes2pod.pl have to worry about the iTunesDB
format: all other tools (gnupod_addsong.pl for example) only have to
deal with the XML file called GNUtunesDB.

   It's important to keep the iTunesDB and GNUtunesDB 'in sync', so
everytime you change the GNUtunesDB (by hand or using
gnupod_something.pl) you'll have to run `mktunes.pl'.

   If 'you' changed the iTunesDB (using gtkPod/iTunes/Ehpod), run
`tunes2pod.pl' *before* using any other GNUpod commands.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.0.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
